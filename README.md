# Memory-Management-Systems

Simulate the behavior of a virtual memory management system that divides the address space into fixed-size pages. Implement the following TLB replacement algorithms:
● FIFO (First-In-First-Out)
● LIFO (Last-In-First-Out)
● LRU (Least Recently Used)
● Optimal Algorithm

Create memory access functions like my_malloc, my_calloc, my_free. The function signature are the same as the original library functions.
A working library, which, after linking to a program, works exactly like the original malloc, free and calloc.
